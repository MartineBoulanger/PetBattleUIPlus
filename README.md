This very simple addon has several options that can be set by the player for customizing and/or improving their pet battle UI.

**NOTE:** This addon is still new, and only a few options are available for now, but in future more options might be added.

To see what options the addon has, use **/pbui** slashcommand in the chat.

Options that can be set by the players:

* Resize the name from the pets in the top bar UI frame -> this can be done outside pet battle or during pet battle, the addon will set the font size, and it will not be resetted when entering or leaving a pet battle.
* Show/Hide the frames (player,target,class pet,party,raid frames) -> **by default the UI will hide the frames during pet battles.** This option can only be used during pet battles to show/hide the frames.
